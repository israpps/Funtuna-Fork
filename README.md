## Differences compared to original FunTuna:

- __Hacked icon (Opentuna/fortuna) is stored on an independent Folder to avoid timestamp changes when updating software__
- Every OSDSYS element is customizable (original FunTuna had top and bottom delimiters hardcoded)
- __Fixed bugs on FreeMcBoot__
- Changed FreeMcBoot settings filename to keep FunTuna settings separated from FreeMcBoot settings on usb
- FreeMcBoot and configurator can load USB drivers from `SYS-CONF` if not found on `BOOT`
- __Replaced fortuna with latest Opentuna__
- __Bundled with [wLaunchELF mod](https://github.com/israpps/wLaunchELF_ISR) capable of fixing fortuna/Opentuna icon date__ (quite stable and 101kb smaller than the original one)
- Bundled with [latest OPL release](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader/releases/latest)
- Installer based on Opentuna installer
- FreeMcBoot and configurator are slightly smaller
- Automatically updated if uLaunchELF is updated
- FreeMcBoot Ported to latest SDK by [Alex Parrado](https://github.com/parrado)
- FreeMcBoot Configurator Ported to latest SDK by [El_isra](https://github.com/israpps)
- Installer will load a preconfigured OPL folder if opl settings canÂ´t be found, saving you the trouble of configuring common settings
- Installer will clean memory card _(Delete folders used by FunTuna fork, or folders that would interfere with Opentuna behaviour)_ before installing
